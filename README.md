# Tic-Tac-Toe
For fivium
Ah tic tac toe, a classic game that u can play anywhere, with anyone at anytime now on the nintendo swit-- ahem pardon me.
This project was both a joy and a pain to make. At one point my code whenever someone won or was tied either the AI would fill up the rest or I could still fill out the rest.
And I couldn't understand why for like 2 hours. I started debugging it until I got to like the last line. And I realised I didn't put play as false. I kept it at true. What a silly mistake that was. 
But it was a joy working on the rest of it haha
